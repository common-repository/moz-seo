* Checks that your page or theme contains H1, H2 and H3 headers with your target keyword phrase
* Checks that your page or theme contains an image with an ALT tag containing your target keyword phrase
* Checks that your page has your target keyword phrase in the first and last sentences
* Checks that your page has an internal link to another page
* Allows you to easily update or change your page's target keyword phrase
* Calculates your page's overall SEO Score each time you publish the page

== Installation ==

To install, simply upload the moz-seo.zip file via the WordPress Plugin installer and click "Activate". 
The plugin is now active and ready to use.

NOTE: When you first install Moz SEO, you will see "Not Set" next to each of your posts and pages. Once you have clicked publish on each of your posts, it will calculate the SEO Score and register the target keyword phrase for that page and it will update the "Not Set" value with the actual value extracted from the page.

You can manage Moz SEO default settings under the WordPress dashboard's "Settings > SEO Settings"
The plugin does not alter any of your content, it simply guides you on what to do in order to maximize each of your post's content to achieve the best on-page seo.

From the SEO Settings page, you can customize the behavior of Moz SEO in order to suit your specific site's setup. For example, If your active theme already assigns the post title to an h1 heading (as ThemeMoz does), the plugin will automatically credit each post or page with the h1 setting.
